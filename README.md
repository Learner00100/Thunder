</p>

### **🔘 Getting Started** :

Let's say you have a bunch of movies lying around in your Drive 
What you need to do is : 
1. Generate an index for the shared drive/folder
2. Deploy to Cloudflare (All instructions on the [Google Drive Index](https://gitlab.com/GoogleDriveIndex/Google-Drive-Index) its super easy)
3. Add the index link to movies folder link ( and username/password if you configured that for index ) in the settings tab, wait until it's done adding  

There you go you have your media Library which sources files from Drive.
(Probably will add video demo soon)

### **🔥 Features** :

- Stream and Download media directly
- No Ads whatsoever
- Cool UI
- You can change Subtitle & Audio tracks while streaming 
- If your phone hardware supports it you can stream it whatever it maybe HDR, HDR10, Dolby Vision
- The app was made to solve a tiny problem with amazing projects like Plex and Jellyfin which cannot use Drive as a source directly



### **🛠️ To Do** :

- [ ] Add support for Shows
- [ ] Better Player UI
- [ ] Remember Playback Position 
- [ ] Add Sort to Library
- [ ] Browse by genre 
- [ ] Add animations
 

### **📋 Notes** :

- Added support GOIndex and Maple's GDindex (GOIndex is unreliable try refreshing if files aren't added)

- Currently video is only hardware decoded (I think) That's why HEVC content may or nay not play at all

- Does not directly interact with Drive rather scrapes the index for movies. The index does the talking to the Drive api

- Sub-folders of current folder are searched now but if the folder has too many sub folders it will take longer to scan

- Even if your files aren't correctly named there is an alternative algorithm which might just extract necessary info

- Media files with no TMDB info are also shown in the library

- Rarely some files may be mislabled if there is another movie of same name on TMDB

- Naming of the files does matter it's better if your files are named like this
	```
	movie.2049.2160p.whatever
	movie.returns.2099.2160p.whatever

- Ideally your folder should contain movie files only like

	``` 
	📂Movies
		└───movie.name.2049.2160p.garbage
		└───movie.returns.2069.2160p.whatever
		└───movie.returns.again.?.2099.2160p.whatever
		└───📂Subfolder <- this folder will be scanned too
